# ChatBot

This project is the project for the college subject "Artificial Intelligence"


## About

This project contains 3 files:
- knowledge.json
- ChatBot.py
- test-API.py


In the ChatBot.py file is the source code of the bot, where it has the "ability" to answer questions that are stored in the json file, if they are not, it will store the answer if it will be given by the user.

In the test-API.py file we have made it possible for the user to communicate with the bot through the terminal window.

And in the knowledge.json file, here are all the questions and answers stored by the bot.

This project, in short, is a bot that learns from the user, if it doesn't know the answer, it makes you tell it the answer.
